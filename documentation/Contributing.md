# How to Contribute

## Branches
Open a new branch from main - or working branches and submit changes to those branches and open a pull request so we can review it.

## Versioning && Legacy Supprt

### Legacy Support
You can defenitly create a clone of an older version as long as its not the newest one because the newest one is usually not LTS.
You can also create your own spice of SUSTAIN
as long as you reference us in your ReadMe as a shoutout :3.

### Versioning
If you do create a new version of sustain just do a short review of how bulky it is:

Versioning Number?
0.0.0.a.i

First Number: Working Perfectly version ex: 1.1.1.a.i => 1.0.0.a.i
This version was the first in this section that was working perfectly

Second Number: Extra Features added onto working version that does that make it a new version

Third Number: Adding fixes to those features and versions

letters (a-> max h) !!Important!!
Maturing the testers for those versions + playing around with wacky features ex: Bunny hoppers, which is the name for testing random codes i the user's code to see if they work.

roman numerals (max ix) !!Important!!

Unless necessary roman numerals as mainly used in this program for branches and branch of branches so you can merge things together, usually squashed quickly (please)


## Example Usage:

current version:

0.3.0.a.i => 0.3.0 for short

Branches:
0.3.1.a.i
and
0.3.1.a.ii

want to merge.

Result:
0.3.2.a.i => you tested the extra features, and used testers and want to merge with another 
person's code (easiest merge requests)

Short:
0.3.2

# When does the second one change?
When the features tackle a new domain and ar enot just adding improvements onto existing ones or adding code that apear similar to existing features

Ex:
Current features include:
- Scanning code
- Scanning Docker

You add the feature:
- Server Testing (A feature that tests bulky software usually require servers or serverless)

=> 0.4.0 easily just make sure to say --new feature and we will review it (moderate time, need moderator approval)

# When does the first one change?
Categories to check:
- Working Product? 
- Features Work in sync?
- Sustainable?
- Resource Hog?
- Deployable?
- Lightweight?
- Scalable?
etc.
If all are yes then congrats
1.0.0 is out. If no, time to get to bug squashing!

0.3.1.h.ix is looking pretty good :3.
